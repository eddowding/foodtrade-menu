<h1>OUR MISSION</h1>
<p>
We believe in good, honest food. We believe that the people who grow and make our food should receive a fair return. We are working to create  a world where food production does not harm the land, nor weaken economies, but restores environmental health, and strengthens communities both economically and socially.
</p><p>
We created FoodTrade because we believe delicious food doesn't have to cost the earth. On the surface, FoodTrade is  a local food map, for anyone, anywhere to find or trade real food. Delve deeper and you’ll see it offers resilience, prosperity and sustainability to small farmers and producers. It creates humanity and connection in the supply chain. It puts an honesty and transparency that has been sorely missing in the last few decades, right back at the heart of the trade relationship.
</p><p>
In 2014, we built FoodTrade Menu to help accelerate our mission of good food, for everyone, forever. If we can help independent restaurants deal with complicated food rules and regulations by using  a simple menu management tool, then we can help them find great local offers on the items they buy. Every ingredient brings us closer to a better, fairer food network.
</p>
<h1>AWARD-WINNING</h1>
<p>
When the new food regulations were announced in December 2014, we knew they’d be a challenge for independent restaurants. And so, eager to help, we jumped on the case and created FoodTrade Menu. Because the tool uses and creates a lot of open data which SMEs can use to improve their business, we entered the Open Data Challenge – a tech competition run by NESTA and the Open Data Institute. In February 2015 we won.
</p><p>
We’re humbled by the support we received during the competition and deeply grateful for this opportunity. With the prize money, we’ve now launched FoodTrade Menu nationally and, most excitingly, we’re growing our team, too.
